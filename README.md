Stack/
Data structure w/limited access- stack, queue.
They collect data, objects and containers can be either arrays or linked lists.
Stack has only 2 operations: pop and push, and the principle is FILO- First in Last out. The example of stack is plates in box, so we need to remove last added plate in order to remove the plate we add first. 
Besides pop and push, in stacks we can define is_empty, peek, size.
The complexity of stack is O(1), which means it finish in a limited time and do not depend on number of objects.
